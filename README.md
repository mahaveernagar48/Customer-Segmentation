<h1 id="customer_segmentation_K_means">Customer Segmentation with K-Means</h1>

Imagine that we have a customer dataset, and we need to apply customer segmentation on this historical data.
Customer segmentationÂ is the practice of partitioning a customer base into groups of individuals that have similar characteristics. It is a significant strategy as a business can target these specific groups of customers and effectively allocate marketing resources. For example, one group might contain customers who are high-profit and low-risk, that is, more likely to purchase products, or subscribe for a service. A business task is to retain those customers. Another group might include customers from non-profit organizations and so on.

The KMeans class has many parameters that can be used, but we will be using these three:

<ul>
    <li> <b>init</b>: Initialization method of the centroids. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> Value will be: "k-means++" </li>
        <li> k-means++: Selects initial cluster centers for k-mean clustering in a smart way to speed up convergence.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> <b>n_clusters</b>: The number of clusters to form as well as the number of centroids to generate. </li>
    <ul> <li> Value will be: 3 (since we have 3 centers)</li> </ul>
    <li> <b>n_init</b>: Number of time the k-means algorithm will be run with different centroid seeds. The final results will be the best output of n_init consecutive runs in terms of inertia. </li>
    <ul> <li> Value will be: 12 </li> </ul>
</ul>

Initialize KMeans with these parameters, where the output parameter is called <b>k_means</b>.
